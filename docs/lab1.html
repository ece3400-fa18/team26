              <p class="item-intro text-muted"> This lab is an introduction to the Aruidno IDE. The team is split into two subteams to perform the same tasks. In the end of the lab, both subteams were able to control the LED and servo, which are then used to build the robot below.</p>

              <h3> Communicating between Uno and IDE </h3>
              <p>In order to test the Arduino UNO and the IDE, we used example code “Blink.” This program caused an LED on the Arduino to blink. The LED on board is connected to pin13, which is also defined as LED_BUILTIN in the macro.</p>             
              <code> // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
                      void setup() {
                        // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
                        pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
                      }
                      
                      // the loop function runs over and over again forever
                      void loop() {
                        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                        delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
                        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
                        delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
                      }
              </code>
              
              <h3> Modify the blink sketch </h3>
              <p>We modified the example code blink.ino so that it would work for an external LED. We tested the digital input ports 2-12 to make sure they were all functional. In order to switch which port is being sent information, we need to change LED_BUILTIN to the number of the port we need to access. The below code is set to work for an LED connected to port 2. 
              (Note: When testing the different ports, we attempted to use ports 0 and 1 but were unable to do so -- we discovered that this is because ports 0 and 1 are typically used for serial communication.)</p>

              <h3> The Serial Monitor and the Analog Pins </h3>
              <p>We used a potentiometer to measure the analog voltages from the input pins. To write to the serial monitor we first opened the serial port at 9600 bits per a second as per the documentation. We then used the inbuilt analogRead method to collect readings from the potentiometer. These values were then printed to the serial interface through the println method. The delay method takes input in milliseconds so to get a reading every half second we set a delay of 500. </p>

              <h3> Analog Output </h3>
              <p>This was an extension of Part 3. Here, as before we used analogRead to get values from the potentiometer. We then used the analogWrite function so that the brightness of the LED would be dependant on the potentiometer readings. As in the modified blink code, the pin corresponding to the LED was set to output in the setup. To compensate for the difference in the range of possible analogRead (0-1023)  and analogWrite (0-255) values the value assigned to the LED was one-fourth the value read by the potentiometer; thus while there was a direct relationship between the potentiometer readings and brightness it was not one-to-one.</p>

              <h3> Parallax Servos </h3>
              <p>During this portion of the lab we practiced using servo motors in different ways with the aim of becoming more comfortable and experienced. Our chosen exercises were particularly the degree of control we had over the angle. In the first code was written to obtain a general understanding of what how servo motors moved. We found that the direction reversed after 90 degrees. The second code is another iteration of the first where we sought to see what would be the effect if the code never reached 90 degrees and found that it consequently did not change direction. In both codes we used the write method from the servo library which allows to control the servo motor as a function of degree.</p>

              <h3> Assemble the Robot </h3>
              <p> Our robot has a purple base plate, and green feet that hold servo motors, which are attached to the wheels. The Arduino UNO is attached to the top of the base plate, and the mini-breadboard is connected to the robot by the wires of the servo motors. The power bank is attached to the front of the robot in order to keep it stable. It is held steady by green wires that tie it to the base plate.
              The following code is the movement demonstrated in the video. The robot goes in one direction for 3 seconds, turns right for 3 seconds, and continues repeating that pattern.</p>

              <h3> Work Distribution </h3>
              <p> The Lab 1 Work Distribution is as follows: <br> 
                  - on 8/31, Nathalia, Priya and Vini worked on steps 1-5 and began part 6.<br>
                  - On 9/4, Priya and Nathalia attended open Lab to complete Part 6.<br>
                  The Lab Report Work Distribution is as follows: <br>
                  - Vini: Objective, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, code snippets<br>
                  - Priya: Materials Used, Part 1, Part 2, Part 6, code snippets<br>
                  - Nathalia: Pictures and Videos<br>
